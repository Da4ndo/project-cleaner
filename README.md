## 📖 Documentation

Project Cleaner is a highly efficient tool that leverages the power of Tokio's multi-threading to swiftly traverse through your project's directories, subdirectories, and files. 

The application also takes exception folders and files, which you can use to specify files and directories that should be ignored during the deleting process. However, the presence of this is not mandatory, and the application will function normally without it.
